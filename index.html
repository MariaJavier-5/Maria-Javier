      I live in Richmond, California with my mom, brother, and dog, Sky.
      Sky is a yellow Labrador Retriever who hates swimming, but loves sleeping.
      We got her when I was going into first grade and now she’s ten years old. I’m also a proud half Filipina.

          I listen to music all the time and currently my favorite song right now is “Truth Hurts” by Lizzo.
          I've gone to many concerts and I don't plan on stopping.
          I also love to watch Netflix and go to the movies.
          I enjoy watching action movies, specifically Marvel movies like Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but I’m always down for a good comedy or romance movie.

        I’ve been out of the country twice; the first to the Philippines with my family, and the second to France with my best friend and part of our French class.
        My favorite websites are probably <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en"> Instagram,</a> <a href ="https://twitter.com/?lang=en"> Twitter, </a> and <a href = "https://www.netflix.com/"> Netflix.</a>

        I created my own filter in Python by creating a function and using loops and conditionals.
